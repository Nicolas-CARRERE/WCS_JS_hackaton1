## Theme: travel / transport / tourism

### Findings:
Google Maps, a reference for any traveler:  
* **Advantages:** ergonomic, many features, international  
* **Disadvantage:** numerous, generic, “imposed” information  

Tourism stakeholders (tourist office, urban communities, municipalities, etc.) with many communication needs / provision of specific and local data  
The mobile, main device used  

### Our proposal: 
**provision of a Google Maps widget - available only on mobile - customized with local information (marketing of the BtoB offer).**  

### From a Google Maps map:
* deletion of unnecessary data  
* adding custom layouts (from an **API** or a **Json file**) with filter system  
* adding POI (Point of Interest) to the user's hand (favorites)  
* integration of **route calculation**  
* **Fully customizable** widget design (global layout, POI layout, Google Map, etc.)
